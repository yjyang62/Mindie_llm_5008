def execute_command(cmd_list: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    Execute a shell command with the given arguments and return its stdout as a string.

    This function runs a command without invoking a shell (shell=False) for security reasons.
    It captures stdout and stderr, waits for the process to complete (with a timeout of 1000 seconds),
    and returns the decoded stdout as a UTF-8 string. If the command fails or times out,
    the exception is propagated to the caller.

    Args:
        cmd_list (List[str]): A list of command and its arguments, e.g., ["ls", "-l", "/tmp"].

    Returns:
        str: The decoded stdout output from the command.
